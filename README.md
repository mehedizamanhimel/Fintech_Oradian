Sample Project for Self Assignment

1. The "Test Case Run" sections are available in the package "testsuits.instafin". Here you can get the tests that you can run for.
2. The "WebElement" sections are available in the package "page.instafin.(pageName)"
3. The package "util" is available if I want the test data not hard coded but saved in a property file and call the values.
4. The project was created in Eclipse. So if you import the project in eclipse, then it will run properly.
5. I've installed chromeDriver from brew, so I will suggest you to install chromeDriver from brew so that there's no exception or runtime problem occur. Also you can download chromeDriver and assign it to project.
The tests should be run as "TestNG Test" to get the results in testNG section.
